# Movies React

Welcome to the Movies React project.

We want to be able to see all Movies we have in our Movietheque. \
We can access our data thanks to an API describe here : http://ec2-15-237-160-101.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com:8828/v3/api-docs 
http://ec2-15-237-160-101.eu-west-3.compute.amazonaws.com:8828/swagger-ui/index.html

## Exercice 1

Create a service to issue requests to the API to retrive the data.
We need to be able to :

- Retrieve all movies by page
- Retrieve all actors or directors (Person) by page
- Get a Person by its ID.

## Exercice 2


Create a React component to display the first 3 Movies in a table. \
This table must have simple borders.

## Exercice 3

Use the new component on the homepage.

## Exercice 4

- We want to get Movies 3 by 3 with pagination
- We need a button to load the next 3 movies
- The button needs to disappear when all the movies have been retrieved

## Exercice 5

We would like to display actors and directors by name and not only their own IDs.
